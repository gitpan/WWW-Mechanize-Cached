Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize::Cached

        [FIXES]
        * Removed a duplicate $key.  Cleaned up some of the internal code,
          and made the variable names more explicit.

        * Added an autocheck=>1 to the t/cached.t test.  Also hits
          time.gov instead of Iain's now-gone website.

        * Removed the SIGNATURE, which I don't intend to maintain.

        On December 29th, 2003, Iain Truskett, the original author of
        WWW::Mechanize::Cached passed away.  I've taken over maintenance
        of the module.  If you're interested in carrying on Iain's work,
        let me know.
