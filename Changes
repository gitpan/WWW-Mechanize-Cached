Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize::Cached

1.27_01
        [THINGS THAT WILL BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * The constructor can no longer take a C<cache> argument to
          specify the parms for the cache.  I'm betting that the
          functionality where W::M::C instantiates the cache for you
          isn't actually used.  If I break your code, please let me know.

        * Existing caches will not work, because I changed the
          directory that they get written to.  It used to go into
          /tmp/FileCache/WWW::Mechanize::Cached, but now will go into
          /tmp/FileCache/www-mechanize-cached.  This is so the Windows
          folks can use the module, too.

        [FIXES]
        * Removed a duplicate $key.  Cleaned up some of the internal code,
          and made the variable names more explicit.

        * Added an autocheck=>1 to the t/cached.t test.  Also hits
          time.gov instead of Iain's now-gone website.

        * Removed the SIGNATURE, which I don't intend to maintain.

        NO NEW FUNCTIONALITY.

        On December 29th, 2003, Iain Truskett, the original author of
        WWW::Mechanize::Cached passed away.  I've taken over maintenance
        of the module.  If you're interested in carrying on Iain's work,
        let me know.
