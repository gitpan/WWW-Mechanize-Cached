1.32    Sun Apr 11 22:19:49 CDT 2004

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added the $mech->is_cached() method.

        * Verified that reusing an existing cache gives you the pages back.

        [INTERNAL]
        * Now requires WWW::Mechanize 1.00, because previous versions
          goofed up the HTTP headers on some requests.


1.30    Sun Mar 14 02:51:19 CST 2004

        No new features.

        [FIXED]
        * Fixed stupid configuration problem in t/bad-cache-test.t.
          If you got 1.28 installed OK, you don't need 1.30.

        [THINGS THAT WILL BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * The C<cache> parm to the constructor is no longer a set
          of parms to specify how the cache will be initialized.  It
          must now be a fully-initialized cache object, probably in
          the Cache::Cache hierarchy.

        * Existing caches will not work, because I changed the
          directory that they get written to.  It used to go into
          /tmp/FileCache/WWW::Mechanize::Cached, but now will go into
          /tmp/FileCache/www-mechanize-cached.  This is so the Windows
          folks can use the module, too.

          However, if you want to create your own cache object that
          writes to /tmp/FileCache/WWW::Mechanize::Cached, for
          compatibility, you can create it and pass it in.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * You can now specify your own Cache::Cache object to pass
          into the constructor.

1.26    Sun Feb 29 23:59:48 CST 2004

        [FIXES]
        * Removed a duplicate $key.  Cleaned up some of the internal code,
          and made the variable names more explicit.

        * Added an autocheck=>1 to the t/cached.t test.  Also hits
          time.gov instead of Iain's now-gone website.

        * Removed the SIGNATURE, which I don't intend to maintain.

1.24    Sun Jan 18 23:10:40 CST 2004

        NO NEW FUNCTIONALITY.

        On December 29th, 2003, Iain Truskett, the original author of
        WWW::Mechanize::Cached passed away.  I've taken over maintenance
        of the module.  If you're interested in carrying on Iain's work,
        let me know.


1.23    December 1, 2003
        Initial version, released by Iain Truskett.
